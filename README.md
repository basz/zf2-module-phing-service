## Installation
### Using Composer (recommended)
The recommended way to get a working copy of this project is to modify your composer.json
in your project root. This will take care of dependencies.

    "require":{
        "bushbaby/zf2-module-phing-service":"~1.0",
     },

and then update

	cd /to/your/project/directory
    ./composer.phar update -v
    
## Configuration

  * Open `.../configs/application.config.php` and add 'BsbPhingService'
    to the 'modules' parameter to register the module within your application.
  * Optionally copy `.../vendor/bushbaby/zf2-module-phing-service/config/bsbphingservice.global.php.dist` to
     `.../config/autoload/bsbphingservice.global.php` to override some defaults.

## How to use BsbPhingService
There is only one command to use which is `$service->build($target, $phingOptions);`. The
build method returns an associative array that contains the return status of the phing
executable, the command has been issued and any output generated by phing (Both stdout and
stderr are captured).

### Controller example
You can create an instance of the Service manually, however it is recommended to retrieve an
configured instance from the ServiceLocator. The ServiceLocator is available in
every controller so retrieval is trivial.

    public function indexAction() {
        $options = array('buildFile' => __DIR__ . '/../../../data/build-example.xml');

        $buildResult = $this->getServiceLocator()->get('BsbPhingService')->build('show-defaults dist', $options);

        if ($buildResult['returnStatus'] > 0) {
      	    // problem
            echo $buildResult['command'];
            echo $buildResult['output'];
        } else {
            // yeah
            echo $buildResult['output'];
        }

        $view = new ViewModel($buildResult);

        return $view;
    }

To get a quick taste you can enable the defined route in module.conf.php and point your 
browser at `http://yourhost/phingservice` to get an working example.
